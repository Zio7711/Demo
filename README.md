This project is a collection of HTML, CSS and Javascript demos that I've created to learn more about web development. It contains the 50 mini projects that are from the Udemy course "50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript" by Brad Traversy. I've also added a few other projects that I've created on my own.

Also, I have created videos for each of the projects. You can find them on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@ziaotan8767
